# multi-auto-shader
Intended for use as a Shader Override. Created using Godot 4.4.1 with Terrain3D 1.0. This shader replaces the overlay texture with an array of textures to allow for multiple auto textures for different height levels in Terrain3D 1.0

Example above has a sand texture, grass texture, and snow texture configured in the array, with the rock texture in the mountains being a standard base texture.
